    - Bon Iver
    - 2016
    - 22, A Million
    - Creeks is probably my favorite song from *22, A Million*.  It highlights the
      instrument he uses throughout the album - the Messina - created on his request  by
      Justin's sound engineer, Chris Messina.  It basically allows him to create  harmonies
      in real-time while he's singing.  Seeing him play this song live is  incredibly
      powerful.

    - 22, A Million
    - Another haunting song off *22, A Million*.  This was the first of these lyric  videos
      released before the album.  I can't begin to untangle all of the  symbolism
      in this song/video, but it seems like the narrator is losing his  faith and
      feeling betrayed by God.  I love the imagery in this whole album.   Every song
      has a number and symbol associated with it.  The symbol  incorporates the number
      in some clever way, like the division sign in the album  cover, a rotated "1"
      with a comma above and below to represent 1,000,000".

    - '29 #Strafford APTS'
    - Bon Iver
    - 2016
    - 22, A Million
    - I added Strafford Apts to show the diversity of *22, A Million*.  It sounds
      like  some sort of futuristic country song - if country ever went back to its
      roots  and stopped being about tractors.

    - Bon Iver
    - This is from Bon Iver's self-titled album, a few years before *22, A Million*.   They
      expanded their sound way beyond their first album.  The video is  beautiful,
      too.

    - Bon Iver
    - 2008
    - For Emma, Forever Ago
    - Bon Iver's first album, recorded in a cabin in the woods.  It's much more  stripped
      down than the later albums, but they still do some pretty cool things.  That
      buzzing sound you hear every once in a while is from an EBow, which  magnetically
      vibrates guitar strings, and the buzzing comes from lightly  touching the EBow
      to the strings.

    - Bon Iver
    - 2008
    - For Emma, Forever Ago
    - "*Skinny Love* was the most popular song from Bon Iver's first album.  Even
      \ before the huge band and experimentation, you can see why they stood out.
      \  Cryptic lyrics, interesting open tunings, that strange falsetto.  The song
      \ still holds up."

    - Happy Birthday, Johnny
    - St. Vincent
    - 2017
    - MASSEDUCTION
    - St. Vincent's songs usually seem like commentaries on society, but for the first  time,
      Annie Clark uses her own name in a song.  It's unclear whether Johnny is  a
      real person she knew or if any of the stories in the song are true, but this  song
      feels deeply personal.  She recalls a time when she "gave [Johnny] Jim  Carroll"
      (author of the Basketball Diaries), and how Johnny seemed to model his  life
      after it.  It's a beautiful, but upsetting song.

    - Strange Mercy
    - This is the first song I heard by St. Vincent.  I just love the way every part  of
      the song builds, letting you hear all the layers of the song come together.

    - Up In Hudson
    - Dirty Projectors
    - 2017
    - Dirty Projectors
    - Dave Longstreth's latest album was about his breakup with his former girlfriend  and
      bandmate Amber Coffman.  *Up In Hudson* best captures the full story of  their
      relationship from beginning to end.  Even in these personal songs, it  feels
      like he is always trying to do new things musically.

    - Swing Lo Magellan
    - Dirty Projectors' songs are usually very eccentric and ornate.  This song is  so
      minimal by comparison.  Longstreth's voice has a lot of character.

    - Swing Lo Magellan
    - I love the energy of this song.  It's so raw and you can hear all the sounds
      of the studio.  The band doesn't seem to take themselves too seriously.  At
      one point someone says, "Uhh, that doesn't make any sense, what you just said,"
      in response to a line of the song.

    - Bitte Orca
    - "*Cannibal Resource* is the song that got me into Dirty Projectors.  Something
      about the production reminds me of *Revolver*-era Beatles.  Each instrument
      and voice is distinguished so clearly and it's so sparse, but adds up to make
      such a magnificent sound.  I recommend listening with headphones if you get
      a chance."

    - You may recognize this from me practicing the guitar riff ad nauseam.  He's
      got such an interesting style, slowing down and speeding up, so consistently
      every time.  The vocal harmonies are great, too.

    - 2017
    - Brick Body Kids Still Daydream
    - This is a song I happened upon looking at Pitchfork's "Best of 2017" list.  The
      album is all about a project in Chicago Mike Eagle grew up in called the Robert
      Taylor homes, and how they tore it down and displaced the people who lived there.  This
      is the last song on the album filled with sounds of his aunt's building being
      torn down.

      thought you'd appreciate this song, since it was written by the lead singer
      about her son when she was pregnant and the doctor wasn't sure whether he would
      survive.  The desperation really comes through in her voice.
